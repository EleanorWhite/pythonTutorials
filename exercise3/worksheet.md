This is a python program that is supposed to take two sorted arrays, and return a sorted array with all of the elements in both of those arrays. For example, if you passed in the arrays [1,3,5] and [2,4,6], this function would return [1,2,3,4,5,6]. 

We wrote some test cases for this program, but when we ran it, it broke on the first one! It will throw an error in the function, try opening the debugger to figure out what is wrong with this program!

(Hint: You will need to change two lines of code, but you will not need to add or delete any lines.)
